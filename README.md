# Horizontal-Picture-Display
A simple web application made using React, in which pictures are fetched from an API and displayed on the screen so that they can be viewed by scrolling horizontally. Pictures have their title diagonally displayed across it, their corners are rounded, and they all have a dropshadow. A button can be clicked to randomly reorder the photos.
